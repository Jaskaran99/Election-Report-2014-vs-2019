I undertook a comprehensive analysis of the 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha elections using Microsoft's Power BI and Excel. To ensure data accuracy, I meticulously cleaned and transformed the data. This process involved identifying and correcting inconsistencies, formatting dates uniformly, and potentially even handling missing values.  After ensuring a clean foundation, I constructed a robust data model. This model acts as the framework for my analysis, establishing relationships between different datasets and allowing for seamless exploration. To further enrich the data, I created additional columns within each table. These columns might represent calculations, categorizations, or other manipulations that aid in uncovering patterns and trends. Finally, I employed DAX queries, a powerful language within Power BI, to craft key metrics. These metrics act as the quantitative summaries that unlock valuable insights from the election data.  Through this comprehensive approach, I have built a powerful tool for exploring the nuances of the 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha elections, potentially revealing significant shifts in voting patterns, party strongholds, and voter demographics.
